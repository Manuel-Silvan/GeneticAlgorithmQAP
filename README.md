# GeneticAlgorithmQAP

This little project testes three popular genetic algorithms on a famous optimization problem called "Quadratic assignation problem" (QAP). 
The topics we will cover in this file are:
1. QAP and Greddy solution.
2. Simple Genetic Algorithm.
3. CHC Method.
4. Genetic algorithm on multimodal optimization.
